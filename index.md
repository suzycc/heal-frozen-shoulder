Quickly, painlessly, and affordably

###### Disclaimer
<small>This is what worked for me. I am not a health professional and claim no particular understanding of the shoulder and how it works. I cannot promise that these methods will work for you. The most important thing to note is that my approach never caused pain greater than a 2 or 3 out of 10. If these methods work for you too, feel free to come back and </small> {% include button.html text="<small>Buy me a coffee</small> ☕️" link="https://buymeacoffee.com/daviddarnes#support" color="#f68140" %} 

## My Timeline
- early August 2022: start of freezing stage (decreasing mobility and quite a bit of pain—especially those zingers which dropped me to the floor)
- early October 2022: start of frozen stage (very limited mobility but no pain)
- mid-January 2023: start of daily hanging
- early March 2023: functionally healed

It's important to note that my dates are fuzzy because I wasn't keeping track, and if a physiotherapist had tested my range of motion in early March 2023, I doubt I would have tested at 100%, but I was close enough that I no longer noticed any deficit in the course of my daily life.

## My Methods
### 1. Hanging
{% include figure.html image="https://www.nohrd.com/media/wallbars/design/wallbars-main.jpg" caption="A Swedish ladder" position="left"  width="300" height="800" %}

I know that the idea of hanging probably seems ludicrous when you can barely lift your arm. But it is possible! A Swedish ladder is ideal because you can climb up to the hanging bar and hook your bad arm on, but you can use a chair or stepladder to do the same thing with any hanging bar. You will likely need a chair or ladder beneath you to hold much of your weight initially anyway. It took me a couple of weeks before I was able to take my feet off one of the lower bars on the Swedish ladder. My first hang probably didn't even last for one full second, but once I could it, it only took me a couple of weeks to get to a point where I could hang for 30 seconds at a time.

I tried to hang 4-7 times/day with a 1-minute rest between hangs. At most, that added up to an investment of 8.5 minutes a day. On really busy days, I only did 2 hangs, which took a total of 2 minutes (2 x 30-second hangs, with a 1-minute rest between.)

I still do two 30-second hangs most days of the week because I'd rather spend two minutes a day looking after my shoulders than ever have to deal with a frozen shoulder again.

## My Tools

These are the tools I used to heal my shoulders.

#### Dr John Kirsch's Book: Shoulder Pain? The Solution & Prevention
Everywhere I looked, I kept reading that it would take 18 months to 2 years for my shoulder to heal. I didn't like that prospect, so I kept looking until I found someone offering a faster timeline—[Dr John Kirsch](https://www.kirschshoulder.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

[Buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/Shoulder-Solution-Prevention-Revised-Expanded/dp/1589096428/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=shoulder%20pain%20solution%20and%20prevention%205th%20edition&qid=1573129382&s=books&sr=1-1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

#### Swedish Ladder
You don't need a Swedish ladder, but it makes things a lot easier and if, like me, you are committed to never having another frozen shoulder, it might be worth the investment. If you're handy, you can build your own [like this guy did](https://www.instructables.com/Swedish-Ladder/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. But really, any hanging bar will do. Your local playground is likely to have something that will work. If you want something for your home, Wirecutter has [these recommendations](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-pull-up-bars/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. You will likely need a chair beneath you to hold much of your weight initially.

#### Powerdot Tens Machine 
When I was in the freezing stage and dealing with zingers and aches, a friend suggested I try her Tens machine to help with the pain. It quickly became my new favourite thing and after a couple of weeks I realized that I did not want to give it back. It really took the edge off the achiness, particularly on those nights when the pain was bad enough that I would have otherwise had trouble going back to sleep. There may be better options out there but I like this one because:
- It connects wirelessly to my phone.
- It is a small, low-profile device—you can put it on and go about your day (or night, if you're using it to help you go back to sleep.)
- The battery lasts quite a while between charges.

#### Recoverytherm Cube 
You don't need this if you have ice packs and heat packs at home. However, my second shoulder started freezing when I was travelling and ice packs and heat packs were not viable options. This cube alternates between cold and hot and is rechargeable. The battery life is not great—you only get 3 x 20-minute cycles of cold/hot on a full charge, but if you have access to power (e.g. on an airplane or in a car), that's not such a big deal. I am convinced this cube helped me arrest the freezing process in my second shoulder.

#### Peloton Barre Classes
I already had a Peloton membership, so this was not something I paid for just to fix my shoulder. I am sure there are plenty of free options that would work just as well. However, if you already have a Peloton membership, or if you have access to a free trial, I highly recommend Hannah Corbin's Barre classes. She has quite a few that have weightless arms sections that are no joke. When I started doing these, I could barely move my left arm. My "arm circles" on that side were hilariously small. But I just kept doing them as best I could in conjunction with the hanging. I think the hanging fixed my shoulder mobility, but doing these classes helped me regain strength in my shoulder and arm as I recovered my mobility.
