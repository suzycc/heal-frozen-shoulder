## My Timeline
### Left Shoulder
- Early August 2022: start of freezing stage (Decreasing mobility and quite a bit of pain—especially those zingers which dropped me to the floor.)
- Early October 2022: start of frozen stage (Very limited mobility but no pain. I moved into this stage approximately 2 weeks after starting to use the Tens machine. I have no idea if there was a connection between the use of the Tens machine and the end of the painful freezing stage, or if I am just lucky that my freezing stage was much shorter than most.)
- October 2022-January 2023: months of not doing anything in particular to heal my shoulder—I was no longer in pain and life got in the way. I did some occasional hanging with a very sketchy set-up before I finally got around to installing a Swedish ladder just before going away for a month in mid-December.
- Mid-January 2023: start of daily hanging
- Early March 2023: functionally healed

It's important to note that my dates are fuzzy because I wasn't keeping track, and if a physiotherapist had tested my range of motion in early March 2023, I doubt I would have tested at 100%, but I was close enough that I no longer noticed any deficit in the course of my daily life.

### Right Shoulder
In Summer 2024, my other shoulder suddenly started freezing. Life had been busy and I had not done my two daily hangs for about a month (I won't make that mistake again!). I came home from a long walk late one afternoon and my shoulder was completely fine. After dinner, I noticed it was sore, and by the middle of the night it was waking me up whenever I moved. By the morning, I was in agony and had lost subtantial mobility. See [Arresting the Freezing Process](#arresting-the-freezing-process) below for how I managed to stop the process in its tracks.

## My Methods
### 1. Hanging
{% include figure.html image="https://www.nohrd.com/media/wallbars/design/wallbars-main.jpg" caption="A Swedish ladder" alt="A Swedish ladder" %}

I know that the idea of hanging probably seems ludicrous when you can barely lift your arm. But it is possible! A Swedish ladder is ideal because you can climb up to the hanging bar and hook your bad arm on, but you can use a chair or stepladder to do the same thing with any hanging bar. You will likely need a chair or ladder beneath you to hold much of your weight initially anyway. It took me a couple of weeks before I was able to take my feet off one of the lower bars on the Swedish ladder. My first hang probably didn't even last for one full second, but once I could it, it only took me a couple of weeks to get to a point where I could hang for 30 seconds at a time.

I tried to hang 4-7 times/day with a 1-minute rest between hangs. At most, that added up to an investment of 8.5 minutes a day. On really busy days, I only did 2 hangs, which took a total of 2 minutes (2 x 30-second hangs, with a 1-minute rest between.)

I still do two 30-second hangs most days of the week because I'd rather spend two minutes a day looking after my shoulders than ever have to deal with a frozen shoulder again.

### 2. Arm/shoulder strengthening
Prior to my shoulder freezing, I had already been in the habit of doing regular barre workouts using the Peloton app. I continued doing these classes after I started hanging. The arms sections of these classes took no more than 5 minutes and I didn't use weights. Initially, I was barely able to do anything with my left arm, but I did what I could and I noticed that the more I hung, the more I could do.

In addition to barre classes, I also did yoga classes using the Peloton app. Again, there was a lot that I couldn't do initially, but I did what I could and it was only a matter of weeks before I could do nearly everything in the classes.

## My Tools

These are the tools I used to heal my shoulders. I have no connection to any of these people or companies other than having purchased their products for my own personal use.

#### Dr John Kirsch's Book: Shoulder Pain? The Solution & Prevention
Everywhere I looked, I kept reading that it would take 18 months to 2 years for my shoulder to heal. I didn't like that prospect, so I kept looking until I found someone offering a faster timeline—[Dr John Kirsch](https://www.kirschshoulder.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

[Buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/Shoulder-Solution-Prevention-Revised-Expanded/dp/1589096428/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=shoulder%20pain%20solution%20and%20prevention%205th%20edition&qid=1573129382&s=books&sr=1-1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

#### Swedish Ladder
You don't need a Swedish ladder, but it makes things a lot easier and if, like me, you are committed to never having another frozen shoulder, it might be worth the investment. If you're handy, you can build your own [like this guy did](https://www.instructables.com/Swedish-Ladder/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. But really, any hanging bar will do. Your local playground is likely to have something that will work. If you want something for your home, Wirecutter has [these recommendations](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-pull-up-bars/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. You will likely need a chair beneath you to hold much of your weight initially.

#### Powerdot Tens Machine 
When I was in the freezing stage and dealing with zingers and aches, a friend suggested I try her Tens machine to help with the pain. It quickly became my new favourite thing and after a couple of weeks I realized that I did not want to give it back. It really took the edge off the achiness, particularly on those nights when the pain was bad enough that I would have otherwise had trouble going back to sleep. There may be better options out there but I like this one because:
- It connects wirelessly to my phone.
- It is a small, low-profile device—you can put it on and go about your day (or night, if you're using it to help you go back to sleep.)
- The battery lasts quite a while between charges.

My physiotherapist told me:
- Not to stick the Tens machine pads on my chest and back at the same time (it's not a good idea to be passing an electrical current through your body near your heart.)
- I could use the Tens machine as much as I wanted/needed and I wasn't going to do myself any harm.
- Setting the intensity to a mild buzzing is thought to have a pain relief effect only. It is not likely to help with healing.
- Setting the intensity to a level where you can see your muscle twitching may having a positive impact on healing.

#### Recoverytherm Cube 
You don't need this if you have ice packs and heat packs at home. However, my second shoulder started freezing when I was travelling and ice packs and heat packs were not viable options. This cube alternates between cold and hot and is rechargeable. The battery life is not great—you only get 3 x 20-minute cycles of cold/hot on a full charge, but if you have access to power (e.g. on an airplane or in a car), that's not such a big deal. I am convinced this cube helped me arrest the freezing process in my second shoulder.

#### Peloton Barre and Yoga Classes
I already had a Peloton membership, so this was not something I paid for just to fix my shoulder. I am sure there are plenty of free options that would work just as well. However, if you already have a Peloton membership, or if you have access to a free trial, I highly recommend Hannah Corbin's Barre classes. She has quite a few that have weightless arms sections that are no joke. When I started doing these, I could barely move my left arm. My "arm circles" on that side were hilariously small. But I just kept doing them as best I could in conjunction with the hanging. I think the hanging fixed my shoulder mobility, but doing these classes helped me regain strength in my shoulder and arm as I recovered my mobility.

## Things That Didn't Make a Noticeable Difference
I have access to extended medical benefits and have had success with physiotherapy, accupuncture, and massage previously, so they were the first things I tried. I feel lucky that my family doctor said to me early on that "Your shoulder will heal on its own regardless of what you do, in 18-24 months. Everyone likes to please their physiotherapist but it won't actually make a difference to the healing process and it will cost a lot of money." 

#### Physiotherapy
It was a physiotherapist who first diagnosed my frozen shoulder, but treatement was on the painful side and the exercises I was supposed to do at home were time consuming and very painful. I saw no positive result from physiotherapy.

#### Acupuncture
Acupuncture felt good but made no noticeable difference.

#### Massage
Massage felt amazing, but made no noticeable difference.

#### Occupational Therapy
I had never tried this before but a friend of a friend said it had helped with their frozen shoulder, so I went for one session. It was not painful or particularly unpleasant, but it wasn't relaxing and it didn't make any noticeable difference. 

#### Hot Springs
I happened to be near some hot springs early in the freezing stage. It felt good to relax in the hot springs but it made no noticeable difference to my shoulder.

## Other things That Have Worked for People I Know
- Someone I know tried hydrodilation and it healed her shoulder. Hydrodilation is the only other "cure" I have heard of firsthand.
- Someone else I know found some pain relief from cortisone shots, but they didn't actually heal her shoulder.
