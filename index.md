#### Disclaimer
This is what worked for me. I am not a health professional and claim no particular understanding of the shoulder and how it works. I cannot promise that these methods will work for you. The most important thing to note is that my approach never caused pain greater than a 2 or 3 out of 10.

If it works for you too, I'd appreciate it if you'd come back and {% include button.html text="Buy me a coffee ☕️" link="https://buymeacoffee.com/daviddarnes#support" color="#f68140" %}
