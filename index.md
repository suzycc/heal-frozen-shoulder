###### Disclaimer
<small>This is what worked for me. I am not a health professional and claim no particular understanding of the shoulder and how it works. I cannot promise that these methods will work for you. The most important thing to note is that my approach never caused pain greater than a 2 or 3 out of 10. If these methods work for you too, feel free to come back and </small> {% include button.html text="<small>Buy me a coffee</small> ☕️" link="https://buymeacoffee.com/daviddarnes#support" color="#f68140" %}

## Tools

These are the tools I used to heal my shoulders.

#### Dr John Kirsch's Book: Shoulder Pain? The Solution & Prevention
Everywhere I looked, I kept reading that it would take 18 months to 2 years for my shoulder to heal. I didn't like that prospect, so I kept looking until I found someone offering a faster timeline—[Dr John Kirsch](https://www.kirschshoulder.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

[Buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/Shoulder-Solution-Prevention-Revised-Expanded/dp/1589096428/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=shoulder%20pain%20solution%20and%20prevention%205th%20edition&qid=1573129382&s=books&sr=1-1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

#### Swedish Ladder
You don't need a Swedish ladder, but it makes things a lot easier and if, like me, you are committed to never having another frozen shoulder, it might be worth the investment. If you're handy, you can build your own [like this guy did](https://www.instructables.com/Swedish-Ladder/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. But really, any hanging bar will do. Your local playground is likely to have something that will work. If you want something for your home, Wirecutter has [these recommendations](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-pull-up-bars/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. You will likely need a chair beneath you to hold much of your weight initially.

#### Powerdot Tens Machine 
When I was in the freezing stage and dealing with zingers and aches, a friend suggested I try her Tens machine to help with the pain. It quickly became my new favourite thing and after a couple of weeks I realized that I did not want to give it back. It really took the edge off the achiness, particularly on those nights when the pain was bad enough that I would have otherwise had trouble going back to sleep. There may be better options out there but I like this one because:
- It connects wirelessly to my phone.
- It is a small, low-profile device—you can put it on and go about your day (or night, if you're using it to help you go back to sleep.)
- The battery lasts quite a while between charges.

#### Recoverytherm Cube 
You don't need this if you have ice packs and heat packs at home. However, my second shoulder started freezing when I was travelling and ice packs and heat packs were not viable options. This cube alternates between cold and hot and is rechargeable. The battery life is not great—you only get 3 x 20-minute cycles of cold/hot on a full charge, but if you have access to power (e.g. on an airplane or in a car), that's not such a big deal. I am convinced this thing helped me arrest the freezing process in my second shoulder.

#### Peloton Barre Classes
I already had a Peloton membership, so this was not something I paid for just to fix my shoulder. I am sure there are plenty of free options that would work just as well. However, if you already have a Peloton membership, or if you have access to a free trial, I highly recommend Hannah Corbin's Barre classes. She has quite a few that have weightless arms sections that are no joke. When I started doing these, I could barely move my left arm. My "arm circles" on that side were hilariously small. But I just kept doing them as best I could in conjunction with the hanging. I think the hanging fixed my shoulder mobility, but doing these classes helped me regain strength in my shoulder and arm as I recovered my mobility.
