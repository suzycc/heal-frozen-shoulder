## My Timeline
<a id="my-timeline"></a>
### Left Shoulder
- Early August 2022: start of freezing stage (Decreasing mobility and quite a bit of pain—especially those zingers which dropped me to the floor.)
- Early October 2022: start of frozen stage (Very limited mobility but no pain. I moved into this stage approximately 2 weeks after starting to use the Tens machine. I have no idea if there was a connection between the use of the Tens machine and the end of the painful freezing stage, or if I am just lucky that my freezing stage was much shorter than most.)
- October 2022-January 2023: months of not doing anything in particular to heal my shoulder—I was no longer in pain and life got in the way. I did some occasional hanging with a very sketchy set-up before I finally got around to installing a Swedish ladder just before going away for a month in mid-December.
- Mid-January 2023: start of daily hanging
- Early March 2023: functionally healed

It's important to note that my dates are fuzzy because I wasn't keeping track, and if a physiotherapist had tested my range of motion in early March 2023, I doubt I would have tested at 100%, but I was close enough that I no longer noticed any deficit in the course of my daily life.

### Right Shoulder
In Summer 2024, my other shoulder suddenly started freezing. Life had been busy and I had not done my two daily hangs for about a month (I won't make that mistake again!). I came home from a long walk late one afternoon and my shoulder was completely fine. After dinner, I noticed it was sore, and by the middle of the night it was waking me up whenever I moved. By the morning, I was in agony and had lost subtantial mobility. See [Arresting the Freezing Process](#arresting-the-freezing-process) below for how I managed to stop the process in its tracks.
