## Things That Made No Difference
<a id="no-noticeable-difference"></a>
I have access to extended medical benefits and have had success with physiotherapy, accupuncture, and massage previously, so they were the first things I tried. I feel lucky that my family doctor said to me early on that "Your shoulder will heal on its own regardless of what you do, in 18-24 months. Everyone likes to please their physiotherapist but it won't actually make a difference to the healing process and it will cost a lot of money." 

### Physiotherapy
It was a physiotherapist who first diagnosed my frozen shoulder, but treatement was on the painful side and the exercises I was supposed to do at home were time consuming and very painful. I saw no positive result from physiotherapy.

### Acupuncture
Acupuncture felt good but made no noticeable difference.

### Massage
Massage felt amazing, but made no noticeable difference.

### Occupational Therapy
I had never tried this before but a friend of a friend said it had helped with their frozen shoulder, so I went for one session. It was not painful or particularly unpleasant, but it wasn't relaxing and it didn't make any noticeable difference. 

### Hot Springs
I happened to be near some hot springs early in the freezing stage. It felt good to relax in the hot springs but it made no noticeable difference to my shoulder.
