## Arresting the Freezing Process
<a id="arresting-the-process"></a>

In Summer 2024, I came home from a long walk late one Thursday afternoon and my shoulders were completely fine. After dinner, I noticed my right shoulder was sore, and by the middle of the night it was waking me up whenever I moved. By the morning, I was in agony and had lost substantial mobility.

The timing was not greatâ€”we were heading off on a trip and would be in the car for fours that day, followed by another four hours the following day, with no easy access to a hanging bar.

I had previously seen the [Recoverytherm Cube](#recoverytherm-cube) online and thought it looked useful but had had no real need for it since we have both ice packs and heat packs in our house. Those are not much good on a long car trip, however, so I ordered the [Recoverytherm Cube](#recoverytherm-cube) online and picked it up at a Best Buy as we left town. During the next two days in the car, I alternated between using the cube and the [Tens Machine](#powerdot-tens-machine)  . 

With the [Recoverytherm Cube](#recoverytherm-cube), I set it to the alternating cold/hot program and I rotated the cube around my shoulder somewhat randomly for each treatment. The alternating program is a 20-minute program: five minutes on cold, five minutes on hot, 5 minutes on cold, 5 minutes on hot. Sometimes I did an extra cold so that I could finish on cold instead of hot. 

With the [Tens Machine](#powerdot-tens-machine) , I really tried to target the shoulder capsule, below the surface muscles. I thought that if I could hit it with enough stimulation, it might stop freezing up. The only way I could do that was by trial and error with the [Tens Machine](#powerdot-tens-machine)   pad placement, and by paying attention to where the stimulation was happening. I cranked the level high enough to make my visible muscles twitch and I could feel the stimulation happening below the surface muscles. It wasn't exactly pleasant but it wasn't painful either.

By the time we arrived at our destination on Saturday afternoon, my shoulder was a lot less painful but my mobility was still restricted. I had access to a hanging bar, so I did four 30-second hangs every day, and continued using the [Recoverytherm Cube](#recoverytherm-cube) (several times/day) and the [Tens Machine](#powerdot-tens-machine)  (maybe once/day). By the following Friday, I could swim freestyle, which had been impossible earlier in the week (I had tried!)

I returned home at the end of the week, and I continued hanging daily, while still using the Cube and the [Tens Machine](#powerdot-tens-machine)  as needed to help with soreness, and within a couple of weeks of getting home, my shoulder felt like it was back to 100%.

I suspect that hanging alone could have arrested the process, but 1. I didn't have easy access to a hanging bar for the first two days and 2. the [Recoverytherm Cube](#recoverytherm-cube) and the [Tens Machine](#powerdot-tens-machine)  helped a lot with the pain.
